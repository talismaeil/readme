readme about the Data Archive Activity - step number six of the assignment
the problem that I was analyzing is how to use Github and create repositories and navigate its functions.
Github is an easy tool to organise your data and related files. It makes archving and saving data files feasible because it documents every change so that it is easy to follow and have someone else pick up on the project.
I like the branches function of Github. It allows you to create different versions of the main file so that you can explore different data aspects without directly making any changes to your main branch. When you want to finalise your work, you are then able to merge your desired branch into the main. The best part is the fact that Github will track those merged changes and will show your version history.
I find that there is a similar aspect in Rstudio, where there is a markup option where you can detail your codes and your steps so that another person can seamlessly follow your project and can contribute. However, this function that I am talking about is not as sophisticated as Github.
